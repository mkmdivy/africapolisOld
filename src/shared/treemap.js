In 10 countries, this share exceeds 66% of the total urban population, and more than 80% in Cabo Verde, Djibouti, Eswatini and Sao Tome and Principe. The metropolitan concentration tends to be higher in countries with small areas and population sizes and low levels of urbanisation. A notable exception is South Sudan with the lowest share of metropolitan population in Africa (11%). South Sudan gained independence only in 2008 and the political system remains fragile, providing little time for Juba to establish a dominant position within the urban system. "

The dominance of national metropoles combined with the proliferation of small towns is explaining the relative weakness of intermediary cities. The stability of the growth of metropolises contrasts with the more irregular evolution of the population of intermediary agglomerations. Over the long term, and even for as short a period as the post-independence period, the trajectory of population growth in metropolitan agglomerations has been characterised by its persistence and relative regularity. However, the combined population of intermediary agglomerations is growing faster than that of metropoles. This is due to the fact that their number grows faster: four-fifths of the agglomerations identified in 2015 were villages or did not exist in 1960. One of the consequences of these developments is that the main discontinuity of contemporary African settlement is not between “urban” and “rural”, but between metropolises and intermediary urban agglomerations. The vast majority of urbanisation studies focus on large cities, whose population figures are the most—if not the only—accessible figures. Agglomerations with 500 000 inhabitants are thus considered as “small cities”, whereas they are in the top 2% of agglomerations in the Africapolis database. A clear distinction between “metropolitan” and “intermediary” agglomerations and their documentation is crucial for urban strategies and policies and for the implementation of appropriate land use planning.",

In Angola, the population of the capital Luanda (7 million) equals the combined population of the next 27 largest agglomerations. In Sudan, Khartoum has as many inhabitants, 5.3 million, as the country’s 248 smallest agglomerations combined (out of a total of 301 agglomerations). These metropoles, in some countries two (e.g. Burkina Faso, Congo, Ghana), or three agglomerations (South Africa), dominate national urban hierarchies. Their exceptional size reflects their dominant position as economic and political centres and their role as interface between the national and global levels. The disparity is therefore quantitative and qualitative.",
